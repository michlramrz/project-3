  <h1> My Top Five Concerts</h1>
  <h4> In my time working for the newspaper, I was able to do some freelance writing and photography and it came with its perks! I was able to see a lot of my favorite artists live and learn of some new ones!</h4>
 
  <h2>#5 Lila Downs</h2>

  <p>
   Lila Downs, her handmade costumes and amazing vocals are well worth any show and/or movie soundtrack.

  <h2>#4. Daddy Yankee</h2>

  <p>
   I'm not a fan of Reggeaton music but, I do have to admit that Daddy Yankee put up a great show and created a great ambience for his audience.
  
  <h2>#3. Natalia Lafourcade</h2>

  <p>
   Natalia Lafourcade is a very talented singer/songwriter, producer and actress. Her music is very pop-like and enjoyable.

  <h2>#2. De La Soul</h2>

  <p>
   De La Soul is one of the best lyrical hip hop bands that's been around since the early 90's. I was fortunate enought to see them live, in part of a former job that consisted of me attending concerts.

  <h2>#1. Los Amigos Invisibles</h2>
  <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1419/5140083017_e14bd1f427.jpg" alt=“amgsinvsbls”/>
  <p>
   I first heard the venezuelan band in 2010 at one of their performances at the Logan Square Auditorium. I fell in love with their music then, what they call "gozadera", we consider funk music. Their lively performances will have you appreciate their whole discography!
